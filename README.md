# google-signin-button
a google-signin-button for Aurelia

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41456403/aurelia-google-signin-button

After following @JeremyDanyow's example around a few corners I came up with this

It works ok for simple usage, but needs help...

when there is another window open using a google login there is an error loading something in the iframe google adds (this doesn't seem to break it)

the listeners don't work for more than a couple of login/logouts at most

Here's hoping that someone else can improve upon this.
